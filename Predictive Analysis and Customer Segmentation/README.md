# Predictive Analysis and Customer Segmentation

The dataset is a transnational one, capturing every transaction made from December 1, 2010, through December 9, 2011, by a UK-based non-store online retail company. 

In this we first perfrom exploratory data analysis for gaining insights of the data and after that we did some feature engineering for creating new features and for finding the anual spending of the members.
After that we did Model implementation and check their performance.
After completing the model implementation we move towards the customer segmentation part. In that we use Kmeans and Agglomerative clustering.
