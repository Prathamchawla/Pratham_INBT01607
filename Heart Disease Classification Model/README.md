# Heart Disease Classification Model

In this we used a heart dataset in which 13 independent features are given and we have to predict the target which means a person have a heart disease or not.
In this first we will perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
After processing and visualisation we will move towards model implementation which will be done by sklearn library.
After model implementation we will evaluate the models and see their performance and we will check that any model is overfitted.If any model is overfitted then we will apply cross validation or hyperparameter tuning to increase it's performance.

## Appendix

In this classification model we use different algorithms and comparre their accuracies. The algorithm used are - KNN,Decision Tree and Naive Bayes.
